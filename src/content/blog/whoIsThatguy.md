# Title 1

## Title 3

Who is that guy. It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Excuse me. I think I know exactly what you mean. Of course not, Biff, now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run em them on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

## Title 2

You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. What, I don't get what happened. Where?

Marty, will we ever see you again? No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. you were standing on your toilet and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible. C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks. Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think. I gotta have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you? Right.

Um, yeah, I'm on my way. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa? He's alright. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

What's going on? Where have you been all week? Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. Huh? Well yeah, you know we have two of them.
